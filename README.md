# AronimosConsistencyTracker
This is a program made to help speedrunners keep track of their consistency in a specific trick/section


--- HOW TO USE ---

Click on the + or - buttons to add or reduce your failled/successful tries of any kind of trick, mission or stage. Clicking with the right mouse button will popup a 'File' menu. In this file, click 'New' to create a new stage and its own practicing progression. Click 'Save' to save the current stage to back it up later and continue training. Creating another stage also saves the last being used. And off course, click 'Exit' to quit the program. NOTE THAT, 'Exit' option won't save your progress, you must always click on 'Save' before quitting.

    --- hotkeys ---
    numeric pad 0 = add fail
    numeric pad 1 = add success
    numeric pad 2 = subtract success
    numeric pad 3 = subtract fail
    


--- THE FUTURE OF THE PROJECT ---

The program will enter an hiatus for at least until the first half of the year ends. If enough people show interest in the project, I will be very happy to implement things we have planned, such as more customizable UI and graphics to show consistency evolution over time.
