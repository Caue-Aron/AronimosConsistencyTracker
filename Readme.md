FAQ:
1. When is version 1.0 comming out? 
    R: I really don't know. I didn't plan any amount of features for it to be considered at version 1.0, but here are some features that will definetily be implemented in a soon future:
    1. Save your progress, so you can really keep track of your consistency through time.
    2. Make so you can have different trackers for each mission/stage/trick you are practicing. You will be able to add as much stages/missions as you desire.
    3. Make a graphical visualisation of your progress (in a Cartesian plan).
    4. Add hotkeys to buttons and/or features.
    5. Add a customizable layout. I plan on making most of everything customizable, but I'll prioritize things such as the programs orientation and alike.
    6. Customizable background with images. This one is questionable, I'm using a very simple framework for the program (Tkinter).
    7. Add as many things as I can/community desires.

2. Why is the program coded so weird/bad?
    R: Because I'm a novice programmer. I have only 3 years of programming experience, didn't even graduate on Highschool yet.

3. Why are there drawings and diagrams?
    R: As an autist, I'm a very, very methodic person. Everything I'd like to do, I always make a plan for it before. No, I won't change this mindset to make new versions faster.

4. Where can I report a bug or make a suggestion?
    R: Message me via discord: Arônimo#1491

5. Why does it take so many time for newer versions?
    R: After version 1.0, chances are I won't touch the project for a very long time. But until there, it is possible that newer versions will take a long time to make. I am a reaaallllyy ocupied person.
